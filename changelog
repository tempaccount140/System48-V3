SYSTEM48 V3.1.2 CHANGELOG - 02/12/2016
*Happy friday update guys!

*Added hotkey functions:
F1 = GodMode (On you)
F2 = BTools (On you)
F3 = ForceField (On you)
F4 = Sparkles (On you)
F5 = Fire (On you)
F6 = Particles (On you)
F7 = Invisible (On you)
F8 = Visible (On you)
F9 = Smoke (On you)
(More coming soon! Give me suggestions in #buyers!)
(You dont need to click the gui, play roblox as usual and use the hotkey commands)

*System48 will run much, much smoother then it used to do
*Fixed up a few bugs and i think i secured a few of the crashing issues
*Every function should work now :P
*I added a "yes or no" to the message box in the apocbadges function (Incase of accidental activation)

*Retcheck is modified on some peoples clients (It is on Quad's)
but for me its fully functional so I am confused :/


- System48 By AzuLX & Quad Core

(I just wanted to add I am so thankful for the support me and quadcore have recieved,
system48 was a massive success and along with everyone enjoying the exploit, my purchasers
have inspired me to make system48 such an incredible hack. Much, much love.)
