SYSTEM48 V3.1.7 CHANGELOG 06/12/16:
*System48 has bypassed the new retcheck issue. It should now not crash for everyone
*Unfortunently, due to the new retcheck, some functions are in-compatiable with Sys48 (Custom particles, etc)
*Removed the changestate tab, its waaay to unstable and too disgusting for sys48, I need to work on it.

System48 by AzuLX and Quad Core
Aided by Customality
